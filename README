# Extreme Temperature Analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook analyzing extreme temperature data.
The project focuses on extreme temperature behavior rather than averages, using surface station data from Météo-France. 
Wet-bulb temperature is derived from temperature and humidity variables. 
Extreme value statistics and machine learning models are used to assess regional vulnerability and future trends.
